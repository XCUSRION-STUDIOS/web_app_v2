Final Levelling System
1. XP Distribution & Stat Growth

    Completing a quest gives Character XP + Stat XP (based on quest type).
    Every X Stat XP = +1 to that stat.
    Stats increase naturally based on quest activity.
    Completing a quest also gives some currency points

2. Character Leveling & Bonus Stat Points

    Character Level increases with XP gain (not stat growth).
    Every level-up grants:
        1 or 2 Distributable Stat Points, so the player can boost a chosen stat.
        A Perk or Passive Bonus (optional, e.g., faster energy recovery, bonus XP, etc.).

3. Character attribute such as Health, Energy, and Mood level up with the character level

The number of stat points of certain points will also affect these attributes
e.g. High emotional stat will increase health

    
4. Both the character level up and stat increases get exponentially harder as the character grows
Why 

This Works:

✅ Quests remain meaningful (stats grow naturally).
✅ Players get strategic choices (stat points on level-up).
✅ Character Level doesn’t feel slow or disconnected from stat growth.
✅ It keeps the Solo Leveling feel (progress through action but with player agency).



Get bonus content if you complete all daily Quests
But you also take loses if you don't complete all daily quest

✅ 1. Full Completion Rewards (Complete All Quests)

    XP Bonus → Gain an extra XP boost (e.g., +10% XP for the day)
    Gems Bonus → Small gem reward (in-game currency)
    Special Buffs → Gain a temporary perk like:
        "Motivated Start" → +5% XP gain tomorrow
        "Refreshed Mindset" → +10% Mood for the next day

❌ 2. Partial Completion Consequences (Miss Some Quests)

    No extra bonuses, just the regular quest rewards.
    Minor mood decrease (-5 Mood, symbolizing frustration).

⚠️ 3. Full Failure Consequences (Complete None)

    XP Penalty → Small loss of stored XP (not leveling down, just delaying progress)
    Mood & Energy Drop → Bigger hit to Mood (-10) and Energy (-5)
    Debuff for Next Day → "Lazy Start" → -5% XP gain tomorrow


    TO DO:

    change history page to shop and add basic design incl; currency amount in top right and maybe two vertical sroll componentts for diff types of items
    DONE

    NEXT STEPS:

    push shop items info to local storage
    for the time being you can only use the perks once, so once they are bought, they cannot be used again. This will be established using the purchased field.
    Once an item is bought, it's saved in local storage under the invetory key.
    When a person presses buy, the game will subtract the cost from their gems and if t number is positive the item will be sent ot the invetory. If they do not have enough money,
    a warning will appear


    add active temp and permanent perks in the skill column
    implement leveling up and not going below 0 in the main page
    When you buy something on the shops page, the game does not remember this!
    Also each item in the store should haave an id nuber. This way only the id number gets added to the inventory and you canm look up the invetory item detials in the item database using teh id numebr
